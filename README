Spamassassin Puppet Module
==========================

The spamassassin::base class sets up basis spamassassin functionallity.
spamassassin::debian adds fuzzyocr und pyzor support, which are set up as 
seperate classes, but are tested on debian until now.

Issues
------
- DCC has a non-free license according to debian, so it isn't included in the repository.
  You have to install it by hand or put third party packages in your local debian repository.
- fuzzyocr isn't included in debian lenny, you need the squeeze package. 

Todo
----
- Support for fuzzyocr and pyzor for other distributions.
- Install Spamassassin config files on other distributions.
- from: http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/UsingNetworkTests
  "Razor and Pyzor, in the past, have intermittently had outages that can result in timeouts and higher system load. 
  Set the razor_timeout and pyzor_timeout values to a low value, if you're worried about this. "
- Add varables to enable/disable the different tests easily (or should this be done in the classes ?).
